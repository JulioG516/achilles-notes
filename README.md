# achilles-notes

The "Achilles Notes" application is  built using HTML, CSS, and Spring MVC.

When a user creates a note, they can add a title and text content, and the note is saved to a database using Spring Data JPA. The application also automatically records the time the note was created, which is displayed alongside the note in the notes list.
